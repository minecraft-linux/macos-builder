### Can I play with an APK?

No, this allowed piracy that is forbidden in this project.

Any attempt to document workarounds or make it easy to import an paid apk without a valid Google Play game license is undesirable.

Game licenses can be revoked at any point of time by you, Microsoft/Mojang or Google, as it happened for all residents of Russia.

Violation of this policy may result in the suspension or termination of this project, which has occurred during the 2022-23 period.

_Exception to the rule are Minecraft Trial and Edu where the latter doesn't work at this time._

For the most current version of this rule, please see https://minecraft-linux.github.io/faq/index.html#can-i-play-with-an-apk
