### Can I play with an APK?

No, this allowed piracy that is forbidden in this project.

Any attempt to document workarounds or make it easy to import an paid apk without a valid Google Play game license is undesirable.

Game licenses can be revoked at any point of time by you, Microsoft/Mojang or Google, as it happened for all residents of Russia.

Ignoring this policy may cause suspension including termination of this project like when it happened between 2022-2023.

_Exception to the rule are Minecraft Trial and Edu where the latter doesn't work at this time._

For the most current version of this rule, please see https://minecraft-linux.github.io/faq/index.html#can-i-play-with-an-apk
